# HyperEntropicPingPong
A beginner ping pong game made using html and javascript.

It's ping pong, but not really.

Level 1: The standard package. Paddle moves up and down, ball moves in straight lines. Hit it. If you don't make it past this level, you really need to work on your skills.

Level 2: The quantum  package. We went from plum pudding to electron clouds in the blink of an eye, and it's up to you to make the adjustment. Obstacles exist to confuse you. Their left and right surfaces cause classical bounces but their upper and lower ones cause the ball to tunnel right through them. Not to mention the periodic mood swings the ball has, causing it to flip its velocity for no reason every now and then. So have fun catching all of that.

Level 3: Everything but faster. Speed increments at a concerning rate now and you need to have really really good reflexes to get through this, in addition to the previous twists.

The obstacles' locations randomise every now and then and there's buttons for you to adjust the speed if you want more (or less) of a challenge after the game hammers you.

Happy bouncing!
